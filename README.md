# Bintang Restu Bawono - Data Science Portofolio 

# [Project 1: Data Science Text Story Classification ](https://github.com/helios190/Text-Story-Classification/blob/main/Text_Classification.ipynb) 
* Created a tool that estimates and classify a Book Genre based on its Short Text with 95% accuracy 
* Using Post Tag Visualizer tu Analyze Subject , Verbs, and Objects to used in the training model and creating a comprehensive Regex Function to Clean the Text
* Using Unigram, Digram, and Trigram to analyze Text.
* Optimized Multinomial Naive Bayes for Categorize and Predict using High Scalability Training Data and Categorize Multi Classification . 
* Implement Vectorizer as a Model Enhancement rather than Hyperparameter Tuning

# [Project 2: Time Series Project for Covid-19 Prediction](https://github.com/helios190/Covid-Time-Series/blob/main/DSA_BabaTech.ipynb) 
In the beginning, we analyze the main problem of Covid-19 that explode at 2020 causes abundance of impact in every segment. Vulnerabiity of societies to this virus needs a serious accountability from some stakeholder. Even though Mask and other health protocol

# [Project 3: Twitter Scrapping & Sentiment Analysis using Natural Langugage Processing](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier) 
For this example project I built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports. This could be useful for someone who is new to sports from a certain country. They could take a picture of a ball and an app could serve them some information about the history and rules of the game. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities. 

I was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user of the app. To get these results I used transfer learning on a CNN trained on resnet34. This created time efficiencies and solid results.
