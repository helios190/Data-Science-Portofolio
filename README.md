# Bintang Restu Bawono - Data Science Portofolio 

# [Project 1: Data Science Text Story Classification ](https://github.com/helios190/Text-Story-Classification/blob/main/Text_Classification.ipynb) 
* Created a tool that estimates and classify a Book Genre based on its Short Text with 95% accuracy 
* Using Post Tag Visualizer tu Analyze Subject , Verbs, and Objects to used in the training model and creating a comprehensive Regex Function to Clean the Text
* Using Unigram, Digram, and Trigram to analyze Text.
* Optimized Multinomial Naive Bayes for Categorize and Predict using High Scalability Training Data and Categorize Multi Classification . 
* Implement Vectorizer as a Model Enhancement rather than Hyperparameter Tuning

# [Project 2: Time Series Project for Covid-19 Prediction](https://github.com/helios190/Covid-Time-Series/blob/main/DSA_BabaTech.ipynb) 
In the beginning, we analyze the main problem of Covid-19 that explode at 2020 causes abundance of impact in every segment. Vulnerabiity of societies to this virus needs a serious accountability from some stakeholder. Even though Mask and other health protocol, This project analyze the correlation of Covid 19 to Mobility and Rate of Polution. To answer this question we use 5 different set of Dataset to predict Covid - 19 upcoming cases, mobility, and Carbon Monoxide rate using Time Series 

* Using 34 Province Geometry,Longitude and Latitude and Utilizing Geopandas to make a Geospatial Understanding of Data based on its location using Geopandas
* Utilize Heatmap to plot the biggest contributor of Acidity in the Polution using Seaborn
* Created a Projection of a future prediciton of Mobility ,Covid 19, and Polution using Time series with utilizing Prophet Library to analyze covid - 19 upcoming predicition in the rest of 2022

# [Project 3: Twitter Scrapping & Sentiment Analysis using Natural Langugage Processing](https://github.com/helios190/Covid-Time-Series/blob/main/DSA_BabaTech.ipynb) 

* Scrapping > 500.000 Tweets using Twitter API by Utilizing Tweepy Library
* Utilize Seaborn,Pandas, and Matplotlib  to form an Explotary Data Analysis
* Creating a Wordcloud Based on its Sentiment using WordCloud Library
* Performing a Bag of Words Sentiment Analysis. Bag of words is a Natural Language Processing technique of text modelling. In technical terms, we can say that it is a method of feature extraction with text data. This approach is a simple and flexible way of extracting features from documents. I use Preprocessing approach to have a better understanding for the model understand the text categorization. Enhancing with Tf-Idf (term frequency-inverse document frequency) which is The scoring method being used above takes the count of each word and represents the word in the vector by the number of counts of that particular word. The Formula for Tf-Idf is (n(i,j)/Î£ n(i,j) * 1+log(N/dN))
