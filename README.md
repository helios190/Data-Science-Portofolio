# Bintang Restu Bawono - Data Science Portofolio 

# [Project 1: Data Science Text Story Classification ](https://github.com/helios190/Text-Story-Classification/blob/main/Text_Classification.ipynb) 
* Created a tool that estimates and classify a Book Genre based on its Short Text with 95% accuracy 
* Using Post Tag Visualizer tu Analyze Subject , Verbs, and Objects to used in the training model and creating a comprehensive Regex Function to Clean the Text
* Using Unigram, Digram, and Trigram to analyze Text.
* Optimized Multinomial Naive Bayes for Categorize and Predict using High Scalability Training Data and Categorize Multi Classification . 
* Implement Vectorizer as a Model Enhancement rather than Hyperparameter Tuning

# [Project 2: Time Series Project for Covid-19 Prediction](https://github.com/helios190/Covid-Time-Series/blob/main/DSA_BabaTech.ipynb) 
In the beginning, we analyze the main problem of Covid-19 that explode at 2020 causes abundance of impact in every segment. Vulnerabiity of societies to this virus needs a serious accountability from some stakeholder. Even though Mask and other health protocol, This project analyze the correlation of Covid 19 to Mobility and Rate of Polution. To answer this question we use 5 different set of Dataset to predict Covid - 19 upcoming cases, mobility, and Carbon Monoxide rate using Time Series 

* Using 34 Province Geometry,Longitude and Latitude and Utilizing Geopandas to make a Geospatial Understanding of Data based on its location using Geopandas
* Utilize Heatmap to plot the biggest contributor of Acidity in the Polution using Seaborn
* Created a Projection of a future prediciton of Mobility ,Covid 19, and Polution using Time series with utilizing Prophet Library to analyze covid - 19 upcoming predicition in the rest of 2022

# [Project 3: Twitter Scrapping & Sentiment Analysis using Natural Langugage Processing](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier) 
For this example project I built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports. This could be useful for someone who is new to sports from a certain country. They could take a picture of a ball and an app could serve them some information about the history and rules of the game. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities. 

I was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user of the app. To get these results I used transfer learning on a CNN trained on resnet34. This created time efficiencies and solid results.
