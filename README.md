# [Project 2: Time Series Project for Covid-19 Prediction](https://github.com/helios190/Covid-Time-Series/blob/main/DSA_BabaTech.ipynb) 
In the beginning, we analyze the main problem of Covid-19 that explode at 2020 causes abundance of impact in every segment. Vulnerabiity of societies to this virus needs a serious accountability from some stakeholder. Even though Mask and other health protocol, This project analyze the correlation of Covid 19 to Mobility and Rate of Polution. To answer this question we use 5 different set of Dataset to predict Covid - 19 upcoming cases, mobility, and Carbon Monoxide rate using Time Series 

* Using 34 Province Geometry,Longitude and Latitude and Utilizing Geopandas to make a Geospatial Understanding of Data based on its location using Geopandas
* Utilize Heatmap to plot the biggest contributor of Acidity in the Polution using Seaborn
* Created a Projection of a future prediciton of Mobility ,Covid 19, and Polution using Time series with utilizing Prophet Library to analyze covid - 19 upcoming predicition in the rest of 2022
